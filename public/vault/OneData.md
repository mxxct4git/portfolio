## OneData Solution

### 1. Background

In the early stages of enterprise development, the **data R&D model** typically evolves in parallel with business growth. As a result, data systems are often built **vertically within individual business units**, leading to siloed, **chimney-style architectures**. Different vertical businesses create independent systems, each tailored to their specific needs.  
&nbsp;  
However, as enterprises expand, **two major challenges emerge**:  
    1. **Rapid Data Growth & Increasing Business Complexity** â€“ The scale of data expands exponentially, and the number of vertical business units continues to rise.  
    2. **Cross-Unit Data Demands** â€“ Business requirements increasingly demand data that spans multiple verticals. To gain a competitive edge, companies must integrate diverse data sources rather than relying on isolated datasets.  
&nbsp;  
This shift toward **cross-vertical data utilization** introduces several critical issues:  
    - **Chaotic data access and duplication** across systems  
    - **Resource wastage** due to redundant infrastructure and repeated data processing  
    - **Inconsistent data definitions**, leading to ambiguity in key business indicators  
    - **Higher barriers to data utilization**, making it more difficult for teams to extract insights efficiently  
&nbsp;  
As these challenges become increasingly prominent, **solving them has become crucial for enterprise growth and digital transformation**.  
&nbsp;  
To address this, in 2016, **Alibaba introduced the OneData solution**, a **data middle platform** built on a **big data storage and computing architecture**. This approach enables enterprises to **unify, standardize, and streamline data management**, fostering efficient digital transformation.

### 3. What I do & learn

ðŸ“Œ In my first company, I worked on data warehouse modeling, primarily based on a star schema design with a four-layer structure (**ODS, DWD, DWS, and ADS**). Through this experience, I learned how to use **Hive to build a data warehouse** and **Spark to process large-scale data efficiently**. Later, I transitioned to **data middle platform development**, where I developed a service to **efficiently retrieve data from HBase for other systems** and created a **high-performance plugin** for **batch data transfer between HBase and Hive**, which was **significantly more efficient than using SCP**.  
&nbsp;  
ðŸ“Œ In my second company, I focused on **data middle platform development**, specifically on building a **user portrait platform**. As the **platform owner**, I was responsible for **designing and developing the entire system**, which included **ETL processes, data quality management, data governance, and data query services**.  
&nbsp;  
ðŸ“Œ During this process, I not only gained experience with new technologies such as **Spring Boot, RPC, Redis, and ClickHouse**, but also started **analyzing requirements from a project-level perspective** and took the initiative to **design the system architecture**. This shift in mindset was a **significant milestone** in my professional growth. Additionally, I worked on **real-time data analysis** using **Spark, Flink, Kafka, and Redis**, which deepened my understanding of **real-time data warehousing**.  
&nbsp;  
ðŸ“Œ In my third company, leveraging my previous experience, I transitioned into **a project management role**, working on a project that aimed to **help enterprises implement data governance and digital transformation**. I engaged directly with clients, gaining **a deep understanding of their enterprise data** and advising them on how to leverage our platforms for **data-driven decision-making**.  
&nbsp;  
ðŸ“Œ This role required **strong communication skills, strategic planning, and the ability to translate business needs into technical solutions**, further enhancing my expertise in **enterprise data management and digital strategy**.
